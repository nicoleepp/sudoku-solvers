# sudoku-solvers

The four implementations chosen to solve sudoku are in:
backtracking.py
exact_cover.py
forwardtracking.py
simulated_annealing.py

All the input puzzles are in:
puzzles.json

They can be run with visible output by running this script (takes approximately 20 minutes to complete):
run_algs.py

This uses some methods in:
utils.py

We measured the time execution with the script:
benchmark_algs.py

We measured the number of initial clues with the script:
puzzle_clues.python
